[section Compiler Support]

_Text_ is written against the C++11 and C++14 standards.  It will use C++14
features if they are present, and otherwise is C++11 code.  Specifically,
_Text_ takes advantage of C++14 constexpr support for much of _tv_'s
implementetation.

Clang versions 3.6 and later (which corresponds to XCode versions 6.4 or
later), and GCC versions 4.8 and later all work.

MSVC support has been tested with Visual Studio 2015 and Visual Studio 2017.
Other versions are expected to work as well, but have not yet been tested.
Note that neither version has correct C++14 _ce_ support.
